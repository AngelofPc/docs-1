You can use the [brevo](https://developers.brevo.com/) provider to send transactional sms to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API.

# Getting Started

To use the brevo provider in the sms channel, you will need to [create a brevo account](https://onboarding.brevo.com/account/register) for accessing your dashboard.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access to dashboard">
        Connect to your [brevo](https://account-app.brevo.com/account/login) dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access to API keys section">
        Click on your organization name on the top right side to show dropdown menu and then proceed to the `SMTP & API` section then click on `API Keys` [tab](https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate your API key">
        Generate if needed an API key by clicking on `Generate a new API Key` button where you can set a name then click on `Generate` button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Getting your API key">
        On the next step you can copy your API key with the `Copy` icon button and keep aside, you'll need it later. Be aware that you cannot get it again later as it will be partially masked and you will have to generate a new one if you lost it.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access to Senders section">
        Click on your organization name again on the top right side to show dropdown menu and then proceed to the `Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs` section then click on `Senders` [section](https://app.brevo.com/senders/list).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a sender">
        Generate if needed a sender by clicking on `Add a sender` button where you can set the `From name` and the `From email`. Email is not used for this provider but is used for the Brevo Mail API.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Getting your sender">
        Copy and keep aside the sender `From name`. It will be the name that will be displayed on the SMS sender name.
    </Step>
</Steps>
